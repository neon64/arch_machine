# Arch Linux personal system configuration

My dotfiles have been gradually becoming too system-specific, including config files and utilities that really only make sense for a specific machine.

Thus this repo will remain seperate from my dotfiles, and deal with all nitty-gritty system-wide configuration. This includes:

- locales, timezones, etc...
- wifi and bluetooth
- power saving tweaks
- driver selection
- bootloaders
- pacman config

## Why share?

Its unlikely that any of these scripts / docs will work out of the box on different devices, however that said I hope there is still something to learn.

I also aim to contribute back to the Arch wiki with some things I've discovered only through experimentation.

## Inspiration

I took heavy inspiration from Arch packages like [this](https://github.com/Earnestly/pkgbuilds/tree/master/system-config).
